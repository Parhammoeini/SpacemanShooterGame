The game is created on Unity and Visual Studio and the character is able to shoot bullets by pressing ' Space ' on keyboard, 
Also its able to move in the screen and change the screen by pressing up,left, right and buttom buttons on keyboard.
meanwhile shooting, I also added a fire which appears in front of the gun after pressing space. 
Meanwhile some assets which in my case they are " Planets" are mpving toward my avatar and the game is about to shoot those planets.
